        <h2>About This Breed</h2>
        <p>A cross between a Chihuahua and a Dachshund, the Chiweenie is a small breed, sometimes with long, floppy Dachshund
            ears. They tend to be happy, easygoing dogs, but when they're young they need a lot of love and attention.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>Small in stature, the Chiweenie usually has the long body and build of a Dachshund, although they could have either
            long, floppy ears like a Dachshund or smaller ones like a Chihuahua.</p>

        <h2>Color(s)</h2>
        <p>Exhibits a variety of colors (in either solid or mixes) including black, blond, brown, tan or white.</p>

        <h2>Coat</h2>
        <p>Short or medium; glossy and silky</p>

        <h2>Personality and Temperament</h2>
        <p>ACTIVITY LEVEL-Low to moderate</p>
        <p>POSITIVES-A Chiweenie is easy going and happy, a sweet breed that enjoys spending time with their families. They
            make fantastic lap dogs.</p>
        <p>THINGS TO CONSIDER-Chiweenies can be stubborn and need a lot of training and attention, especially when they are
            young puppies. A Chiweenie can also be very quiet or quite the barker. They can become jealous of other animals
            and people, and don't necessarily do well in households with other pets.</p>

        <h2>Care</h2>
        <p>IDEAL LIVING CONDITIONS-This small breed does well in both small apartments or large homes. Because exercise isn't
            especially important, they do well with either a small daily walk or a quick romp around an enclosed backyard.</p>

        <p>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS-The Chiweenie requires regular bathing, although their coats are extremely low maintenance.
            They are a stubborn breed, though, and training may be difficult. They also tend towards jealousy and don't do
            well in homes with other pets, and some may bark excessively.</p>

        <p>Health-The breed tends towards ear infections and other issues that commonly occur with small dogs, like knee and
            back problems.</p>

        <p>History and Background-This energetic mixed breed became popular only recently — around the 1990s — mostly due to
            their small size, easygoing personalities and low maintenance coats. Besides their overall looks, the breed doesn't
            share much in common with their hunting dog ancestors, the Dachshund, and tend more towards their Chihuahua roots
            in terms of activity level and personality.</p>
